⚠️  DEPRECATED - These scripts are no longer supported ⚠️

As of February 2026, file-based ingestion has been removed from the application.
The application now ONLY supports ingestion through the API REST endpoint for bulk uploads.

These scripts are kept for historical reference but will not function with the current codebase:
- gleam_to_csv.py - Legacy script to write GLEAM catalog as CSV
- post_rcal_file.py - Legacy script to post files to the database
- sky_model_client.py - Legacy client example

For current usage, please use the /upload-sky-survey-batch API endpoint with in-memory content.
See the documentation in docs/src/userguide/batch_upload.rst for details.
